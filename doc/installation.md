Installation
============

Install with pip from PyPI
--------------------------

The latest stable version of the echemdbconverters is available on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/echemdbconverters/) for all platforms and can be
installed if you have Python and pip installed already:

```sh
pip install echemdbconverters
```

This command downloads and installs the echemdbconverters and its dependencies into
your local Python installation.

If the above command fails because you do not have permission to modify your
Python installation, you can install the echemdbconverters into your user account:

```sh
pip install --user echemdbconverters
```

You can instead also install the latest unreleased version of the echemdbconverters
from our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/echemdb/echemdbconverters) with

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/echemdb/echemdbconverters@main
```

Install with pip for development
--------------------------------

If you want to work on the echemdbconverters itself, install [pixi](https://pixi.sh)
and get a copy of the latest unreleased version of the echemdbconverters:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/echemdb/echemdbconverters.git
```

To launch the echemdbconverter, run:

```sh
pixi run svgdigitizer
```

Any changes you make to the files in your local copy of the echemdbconverters should
now be available in your next Python session.

To build the documentation locally, run

```sh
pixi run doc
```

and to run all doctests, run

```sh
pixi run doctest
```

We would love to see your contribution to the echemdbconverters.
